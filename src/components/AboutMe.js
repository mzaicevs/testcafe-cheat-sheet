      If you haven't guessed by now, this web app is designed as a Cheat Sheet
      to TestCafe. It's aim is to accelerate your usage of TestCafe with quick
      information. It's not designed to be a replacement for TestCafe's
      documentation, but rather a quick "what was that thing again?" answer
      book.

    <Card.Text>A number of reasons, really. The big drivers were:</Card.Text>

          I had started innovating at work with TestCafe on a front-end offering
          and constantly read and referred back to the TestCafe documentation,
          often for the next tidbit of information I needed. In fairness to the
          TestCafe maintainers, their documentation is nicely laid out and their
          search bar is super helpful. I just wanted to be selfish and have what
          I thought as the important information in a single page that I could
          refer back to with ease.

            I feel a sense of personal aimlessness if I'm not pumping out code
            or projects every so often. Partly inspired by
            <CardLink
              href="https://devhints.io/"
              text="devhints.io"
              withPreceedingSpace
            />
            ; I found an excuse to actually read the TestCafe docs more
            in-depth, experiment more with component libraries, and chase
            Lighthouse approval metrics. As it's mostly static information, I
            felt like it was low-hanging fruit I could pump out fairly quickly
            while learn and experiment that little bit more.
